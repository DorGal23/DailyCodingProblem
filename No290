/**
 * On a mysterious island there are creatures known as Quxes which come in three colors: red, green, and blue.
 * One power of the Qux is that if two of them are standing next to each other, they can transform into a single creature of the third color.
 *
 * Given N Quxes standing in a line, determine the smallest number of them remaining after any possible sequence of such transformations.
